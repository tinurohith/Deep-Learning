# Deep-Learning
      Have created two models for the fashion datasets. First model created using TensorFlow and the later using Keras.
       In both the models, got a model accuracy of 100%. The graph obtained are Model accuracy Vs Epoch and Model loss Vs Epoch
       In the graph Model accuracy Vs Epoch, we conclude that as the epoch increases the model accuracy of train dataset increases upto 1(max), whereas the model accuracy of validation remains constant.
       In the graph Model loss Vs Epoch, we conclude that as the epoch increases the mode loss decreases drastically at the beginning and then it decreases marginally down to zero, whereas the model  loss of validation also decreases down to zero as epoch increases.
       From the graph, we can conclude that with increase in epoch or higher values of epoch, the model accuracy increases and there is a sign of ‘overfitting’.
       We are able to delete so much of the network without hurting performance because the neural network models detect non-linearity relationship between the target and independent variables that are complex and identify the unique pattern.
